## Initialization

### Creating a Project

    # Creating the Project
    $ rails new <project-name>

    # Install Dependencies
    $ bundle install

    # Open the directory
    $ cd <project-name>

    # Run the project
    $ rails start

### Initialization Steps for Twitter Bootstrap 3
1. **Configurations for bootstrap-sass in Gemfile.** The gem `bootstrap-sass` must be added to the Gemfile. Also, make sure that the `sass-rails` is available on the Gemfile.

        gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.2.0'
        gem 'sass-rails', '~> 4.0.3'


2. **Stylesheet Configuration** Rename the following file `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` to `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss`. This configuration is for the Sass CSS pre-processor, which is a dependency of the Bootstrap configuration.

        @import "bootstrap-sprockets";
        @import "bootstrap";

    These files must be included just under the `*=require` statements on the file.

3. **Javascript Configuration** Require the Bootstrap Javascript dependencies by adding the following lines to your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` file.

        //= require jquery
        //= require bootstrap-sprockets

    **Note:** Coffeescript can be used interchangeably with Javascript for the application.


## Program Logic

### Generate Controllers and Models
Rails can create controllers and models automatically for your application.

    rails generate model <entityname>

This will create two new files in your project: `app/controllers/<EntityName>_controller.rb` and `app/models/<EntityName>.rb`.

### Define the Information Schema and Migrations
To define the attributes of the your models, you can run the following:

    # rails generate model <entityname> attribute_name:data_type
    # A sample of an actual model generation command for a Category model:
    rails g model Category category_name:string category_code:integer

    # rails generate scaffold <entityname> attribute_name:data_type
    # A sample of an actual model generation command for a Category model:
    rails g scaffold Category category_name:string category_code:integer

Scaffolding creates the model, the view, and the controller file as well as the stylesheet.
After you've finished creating the models for your application, migrations must be run to configure the database for the model. To do so, run the following commands:

    rake db:migrate


### Recommended Gems

These gems are listed in the application `Gemfile`.
Gems are libraries following the bundle package manager for Rails. Listed bellow are some utility gems that will be useful in RoR application development.

    gem 'seed_dump'
    gem 'turbolinks'
    gem 'annotate', ">=2.6.0"
    gem 'fabrication'
    gem 'faker'


To install these, run `bundle install` in the console within the root of the app.
TODO: Include manual migrations, recommended gems, routing, and model relations.
